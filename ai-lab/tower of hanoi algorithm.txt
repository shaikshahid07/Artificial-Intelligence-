ALGORITHM:
1. The base case for solving the Towers of Hanoi with one disk is to directly move the disk from the source peg to the destination peg.
2. For `N` disks, we can recursively solve it by following these steps:
   - Move `N-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the destination peg as the auxiliary.
   - Move the `N`-th disk from the source peg to the destination peg.
   - Move the `N-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg, using the source peg as the auxiliary.
