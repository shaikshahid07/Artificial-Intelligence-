Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Read the cryptarithm problem (e.g., SEND + MORE = MONEY)
- Identify the variables (letters) and their possible values (0-9)

Step 2: Initialize
- Create a dictionary to store the mapping of letters to numbers (e.g., S = 9)
- Initialize an empty solution set

Step 3: Analyze the Problem
- Identify the carry-over positions (e.g., D + E might carry over to N)
- Identify the unique letters and their constraints (e.g., S cannot be 0)

Step 4: Use Constraints to Reduce Possibilities
- Apply the following constraints:
    1. Each letter has a unique value.
    2. Leading digits cannot be 0.
    3. Carry-over positions must be consistent.
    4. Number ranges (e.g., 0-9)

Step 5: Use Trial and Error or Backtracking
- Start with the most constrained letter (e.g., S)
- Try each possible value for the letter
- If a value leads to inconsistency, backtrack and try another value
- Repeat for each letter

Step 6: Verify the Solution
- Check if the solution satisfies all constraints
- If valid, add to the solution set
