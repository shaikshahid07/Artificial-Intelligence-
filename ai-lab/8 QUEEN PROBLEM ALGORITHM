Step 1: Initialize
 Create an 8x8 chessboard (matrix)
 Set all positions to "empty" (0)


Step 2: Place Queens

Start from row 1
 For each row:
    1. Try to place a queen in each column
    2. Check if the queen is safe (no other queen attacks it)
    3. If safe, move to the next row
    4. If not safe, try the next column


Safety Check:

Check rows, columns, and diagonals for other queens
If another queen is found, return "not safe"


Backtracking:

If no safe position is found in a row, go back to the previous row
Remove the queen from the previous row
Try the next column in the previous row

Solution Found:

If 8 queens are placed safely, display the solution
