ALGORITHM:
1. Define the initial state of the monkey, banana, and box positions.
2. Define predicates for actions like `move`, `climb`, `push`, and `grasp` which change the state of the monkey and the box.
3. Create a predicate `solve` which specifies a sequence of actions to move the monkey to the banana and then to the box with the banana.
