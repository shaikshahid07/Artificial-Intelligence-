Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Start from a root node (initial node):

Choose the node where the search will begin, called the root node.
Initialize the queue and visited list:

Create an empty queue (FIFO structure) and add the root node to the queue.
Create an empty set/list to keep track of visited nodes.
While the queue is not empty:

Remove the node at the front of the queue (current node).
If the node has not been visited:
Mark it as visited (add it to the visited set/list).
Process the node (e.g., print or store its value).
Add all its unvisited neighbors (connected nodes) to the queue.
Repeat:

Continue this process until the queue becomes empty.
End:

The BFS is complete when the queue is empty and all reachable nodes from the root have been visited.
