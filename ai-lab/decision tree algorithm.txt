The Decision Tree algorithm is a popular machine learning method used for classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on certain feature values to create a tree structure. The tree is made up of nodes, branches, and leaves. Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents an outcome or prediction.

Steps in the Decision Tree Algorithm:
Start with the entire dataset as the root of the tree.

Select the best feature to split the data. The choice of feature is based on a metric like:

Gini impurity: Measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly classified.
Entropy/Information Gain: Measures the amount of uncertainty or disorder in the data.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Used for regression tasks to minimize prediction errors.
Split the dataset into subsets based on the selected feature. This creates branches from the current node.

Repeat the process recursively for each branch:

For each subset, choose the best feature to split the data further.
Continue splitting until one of the following conditions is met:
All data points in a node belong to the same class (for classification).
Maximum depth is reached.
No further improvement is possible.
Assign a class label or value to each leaf node (terminal node) based on the majority class (classification) or average value (regression).
