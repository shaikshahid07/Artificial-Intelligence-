Initialize the game board as a 3x3 grid filled with empty spaces.
Loop until there is a winner or the board is full:
Take input for the current playerâ€™s move (row, column).
Check if the move is valid (i.e., if the chosen cell is empty).
Update the board with the current player's mark (X or O).
Check if the current player has won by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.
If a win is detected, declare the current player as the winner.
If no win and the board is full, declare a draw.
Switch turns between the players.
End the game when there's a winner or a draw.
