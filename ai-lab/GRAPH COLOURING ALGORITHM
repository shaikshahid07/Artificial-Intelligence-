Greedy Algorithm for Graph Coloring:
The Greedy Algorithm assigns colors to the vertices one by one. For each vertex, it selects the smallest available color that hasnâ€™t been assigned to any of its adjacent vertices.

Greedy Algorithm Steps:
Start with the first vertex and assign it the first color.
For each subsequent vertex:
Examine the colors of all adjacent vertices.
Assign the smallest color that is not being used by any of its neighbors.
Repeat this process until all vertices are colored.
